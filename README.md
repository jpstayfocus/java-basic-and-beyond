# Java Programming

## ðŸ‘‰ Introduction

### What is Java?
- object oriented programming lannguage
- create by James Gosling in 1995
- similar to c++ but easier
- 3 billion devices ru  Java programs
- very popular

### What can you build with Java
- Mobile apps for Android (Kotlin is more common or Swift)
- Desktop App using Java Swing, JavaFX
- Enterprise Applications
- Games (such as [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft))
- Cloud based applications
- Web applications


### Java Usages
- Build enterprise application

### Compiled Vs Interpreted language
- [Difference between Compiler and Interpreter in Java](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/difference-between-compiler-and-interpreter-in-java)
- A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that computer's processor uses.
- The interpreter read each stateemnt of code and then converts or executes it directly

### Static vs Dynamic Type Checking
- The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types - type checking - may occur either at compile time (static check) or at a run-time (dynamic check)
- Static type checking is when types are checked during compilation, before the program is run. This means that any type errors will be caught early on and can be fixed before the program is deployed. Dynamic type checking, on the other hand, happens at runtime. This means that type errors can go undetected until the program is actually being used.

## ðŸ‘‰ The basics

The example codes for the following subjects can be found [here](https://github.com/jpstayfocus/java-basic-and-beyond/tree/main/the%20basics)

- [Reverse keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_keywords.asp)
- Comments
    - two ways to add comments
    - use "//" (single ligne comments) or "/*" and "*/" (Multi Line comments)
    - Comments has no effect when you run a code.
- Variables
      - A varibles allows us to store a value into a placeholer which we can use it later 
- Primitives Data Types Differences
- Numeric Literals with underscore
- Arithmetic operarors
- Increment and Decrement Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Short and re-assignment
- Namimng Variables
- Strings
- Reference types and objects
- Reference types and objects differences
- Pass py Value differences
- Arrays
- O and null Values for arrays
