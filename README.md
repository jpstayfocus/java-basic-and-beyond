# Java Programming

## ðŸ‘‰ Introduction

### What is Java?
- object oriented programming lannguage
- create by James Gosling in 1995
- similar to c++ but easier
- 3 billion devices ru  Java programs
- very popular

### What can you build with Java
- Mobile apps for Android (Kotlin is more common or Swift)
- Desktop App using Java Swing, JavaFX
- Enterprise Applications
- Games (such as [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft))
- Cloud based applications
- Web applications


### Java Usages
- Build enterprise application

### Compiled Vs Interpreted language
- [Difference between Compiler and Interpreter in Java](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/difference-between-compiler-and-interpreter-in-java)
- A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that computer's processor uses.
- The interpreter read each stateemnt of code and then converts or executes it directly

### Static vs Dynamic Type Checking
- The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types - type checking - may occur either at compile time (static check) or at a run-time (dynamic check)
- Static type checking is when types are checked during compilation, before the program is run. This means that any type errors will be caught early on and can be fixed before the program is deployed. Dynamic type checking, on the other hand, happens at runtime. This means that type errors can go undetected until the program is actually being used.

## ðŸš© Environement setup (Intellij IDEA)
* Go to the offical website of [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* If you are a student, you can get InteliJ IDEA free.

## ðŸ‘‰ The basics

The example codes for the following subjects can be found [here](https://github.com/jpstayfocus/java-basic-and-beyond/tree/main/the%20basics)

- [Reverse keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_keywords.asp)
  
- Comments
    - two ways to add comments
    - use "//" (single ligne comments) or "/*" and "*/" (Multi Line comments)
    - Comments has no effect when you run a code
  
- Variables
      - A varibles allows us to store a value into a placeholer which we can use it later
   
- [Primitives Data Types Differences](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp)
    - Primitives types are used to store simple values. For instance, whole numbers, decimal values and characters:
        - boolean
        - byte
        - short
        - char
        - int
        - long
        - float (store decimal value, but bigger number and take more space in memory)
        - double

- Numeric Literals with underscore
    - Reprensent big numbers with underscore for readability

- O and null Values for arrays



## ðŸ‘‰ Loops

code snipet can be found [here](https://github.com/jpstayfocus/java-basic-and-beyond/new/main)

loops - constraint that allows us to repeat a block of codes

- While loop
- Do while

## ðŸ‘‰ 'if' Stateements
code snipet can be found [here](https://github.com/jpstayfocus/java-basic-and-beyond/tree/main/if-statement)

if statement allows us to execute a block of codes based on a condition

- if statement
- if statement with conditions
- Else if
- AND logical operator
- OR logical operator
  
- [logical operators recap](https://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/opsummary.html)
    - a review of the chapter logic in discrete math  or discrete structure or math for computer science can help
    - a recommended course for [discrete math](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)

- Switch

  Use switch to replace nested if conditions
